>## Description
  
This is a simple blogging app build using node, express, handlebars with a MYSQL database to store and retrieve blog posts. 
A user is presented with a log in / sig up screen where they can create or log in into their account. Once logged in, the user is taken to the home page where they can view all posts posted by other users . when a user clicks on a post they are taken to a post screen where they can see all comments related to that post and they have the ability to comment themselves. 
On the users own dashboard the user can create a new post or edit and delete their current posts. 
The app is hosted on a Heroku serve with the posts and comments MYSQL database being hosted on a JAWdb server.
